                    The book is designed to cater to a broad spectrum of readers, ranging
                    from cyber-security experts and policy-makers to academics. Despite
                    its intended primary audience, the book has also been written in such
                    a manner as to make it accessible not only to university students but
                    the broader general public. The complexity and rate of change seen
                    within areas of technology, cyber security, and ethical hacking make
                    it essential not to assume that you are across all terminology. There
                    are many terms that common media and blogs use incorrectly or
                    interchangeable, such as “computer virus,” which turns out to be a
                    “computer worm.” Other new methods of malicious-software propagation
                    may emerge that a reader would not necessarily be familiar
                    with. In general, ethical hacking involves many technical terms
                    that require a foundational level of understanding in order to better
                    understand policy and other issues. For example, a denial-of-service
                    attack is potentially lawful if your own device is used to participate
                    in an online political protest. <br> It would not be lawful to use a botnet
                    that connects to unknown or third-party devices to participate in
                    the same protest. The aim is to provide you with digestible material
                    that demonstrates concepts through engaging case studies. These
                    case studies of ethical hacking, spanning the last twenty years, are
                    dissected and catalogued in a manner that identifies the groups and
                    movements, their motivations, and the techniques they used. You
                    will see some of the most notorious of these incidences explored
                    referenced in chapters 4–6, then selected incidences are looked in
                    context and by issues in chapters 7–13. <br>
                    If you are a policy-maker, chapters 3–7 and 14 are essential
                    reading. Chapter 3 provides the only publicly available quantitative
                    analysis of ethical hacking in the world. The stark numbers contained
                    within this chapter will assist you in demonstrating why the decisions
                    and policies you recommend are fundamentally essential. As a
                    policy-maker, you are all too aware that in a world of cleverly masked
                    sensationalism posing as substantive information it has become difficult
                    to discern what information can be trusted. Chapters 4–6 table
                    legal cases and selected noteworthy incidences from the quantitative
                    analysis. Throughout chapters 7–13 I aim to provide you with
                    Why Ethical Hacking? 3
                    <img src="./img/ship.jpg" alt="ship"><br>
                    intricate and, at times, intimate looks at the world of ethical hacking,
                    which will assist you in generating well-informed and robust policy.
                    Chapter 14 discusses the required frameworks and changes required
                    as a matter of both policy and law.
                    If you are a cyber-security expert or consider yourself a hacktivist,
                    there are ethical and legal issues contained within this book
                    that are essential reading. This includes policy and legal lines to be
                    cautious of, which could easily see you cross from that of “ignore
                    action with caution” to one of “prosecute” by authorities. These
                    cautionary tales are drawn from my experience undertaking a large
                    range of roles, as described above.
                    As I know all too well, the issues surrounding cyber security
                    have garnered interest from a broad demographic of society, and is
                    not limited to just policy-makers, experts, and academics. Even if
                    you do not fit within any of the three later categories, I would still
                    love for you to drop me a line at alanacybersecurity.com and let me
                    know your background. While I keep analytics on how many people
                    visit the site, and the general geographic area of the IP addresses, this
                    will give me an opportunity to engage with you and understand the
                    broader community interests. But please remember that if you are
                    looking at the site or wish to contact me about a private or sensitive
                    matter, this site offers no anonymity to you. So, connect with a VPN,
                    proxy or other anonymizer such as TOR.
